cases,"Cases are a measurement of unique services. The meaning of the value found in cases vary by service type. For hospital inpatient services, cases represent admits. Hospital outpatient services, cases essentially represent unique events at the outpatient facility.

A labeler is any firm that manufactures, repacks, or distributes a drug product. The second segment, the product code, identifies a specific strength, dosage form, and formulation for a particular firm. The third segment, the package code, identifies package sizes. Both the product and package codes are assigned by the firm. The NDC will be in one of the following configurations: 4-4-2, 5-3-2, or 5-4-1."
claim_status_orig,"This field contains the status of the claim as reported by the payer on the remittance. Note that the claim status code is specific to each service line of a claim. Claims processed as secondary may have dramatically lower payments for services rendered because another payer had primary responsibility.

In studying the cost of a specific procedure, a claim that is not processed as primary may reflect only a partial payment. This field links to the REF_CLAIM_STATUS table.
